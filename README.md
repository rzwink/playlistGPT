# r/YourBaroness Inspired Playlist Generator

A Python-based application inspired by a Reddit post on r/YourBaroness. I asked for music recommendations similar to Baroness, which led to a rich thread of responses from the community. This application takes those recommendations, processes them, and creates a Spotify playlist featuring popular tracks from the mentioned bands.

## Features

- **Text Analysis:** Utilizes OpenAI's API to extract band names from a given text input.
- **Caching:** Implements caching for band names, song names, and track IDs to minimize redundant API calls and enhance performance.
- **Spotify Integration:** Interacts with the Spotify API to fetch the most popular songs for each band and compiles them into a playlist.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Spotify Developer Account for API credentials
- OpenAI API key
- Flask (for web server functionality)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `spotipy`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `openai`

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PlaylistGPT.git
   cd PlaylistGPT
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install spotipy python-dotenv openai Flask
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Spotify and OpenAI API credentials:

   ```
   OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server:**

   The `app.py` script initializes a Flask web server for Spotify authentication.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888` in your browser and complete the Spotify authentication process.

2. **Generate a Spotify Playlist:**

   Once authenticated, you can run the `make_playlist.py` script to generate the playlist based on the extracted band names.

   ```bash
   python make_playlist.py
   ```

   - This script will read the input text, extract band names, retrieve their most popular songs, and create a playlist on your Spotify account.

### Maintaining the Application

- **Caching:** The application uses JSON files for caching band names, songs, and track IDs. These files (`band_name_cache.json`, `song_cache.json`, `track_cache.json`) are automatically updated with each execution. To refresh the cache, simply delete these files.

- **API Key Management:** Ensure your API keys in the `.env` file are kept secure and are regularly rotated as per best security practices.

- **Dependencies:** Periodically check for updates to the `spotipy`, `openai`, and `Flask` libraries to ensure compatibility with Spotify and OpenAI API changes.

- **Custom Input:** Modify the `input_text` variable in `make_playlist.py` with different text to generate playlists based on other Reddit threads or text sources.
